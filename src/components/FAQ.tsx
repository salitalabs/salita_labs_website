    question: "Will this work with my ServiceTitan/Housecall Pro?",
    answer: "Yes. We integrate with your existing system—no platform switching. Your FSM stays exactly where it is.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my customers don't like talking to AI?",
    answer: "They won't know the difference. Emergencies route straight to your on-call tech. Everything else gets handled professionally with escalation if needed. It sounds like your business, not a robot.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much of my time does this take?",
    answer: "Setup takes ~2 hours of interviews so we learn your business. After that, about 15 minutes per week reviewing performance. We handle everything else.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do my CSRs already handle follow-ups—why do I need this?",
    answer: "They do, but not with precision timing at 9pm on Saturday. We systematize the cadence so nothing slips through—especially after-hours and weekends when most calls are missed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I want to stop?",
    answer: "60-day cancellation policy, easy. If it's not working, we shut it down and part ways professionally.",
  },
  {
    question: "I already have a website. Why would I need yours?",
    answer: "If your site's working, we can connect it to the phone system. If it's not converting visitors to calls, we'll build one that does—for less than one job pays you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to understand the technology?",
    answer: "Nope. You run your business. We support it. That's the deal.",
  },
